# TU-GUT-SYSY-v36-Complete-Topological-Bootstrap-Vacuum-Engineering-Designs


Version 36 (December 2025) completes the Topological Bootstrap Unified Framework, integrating all prior modules into a coherent picture from cosmic origin to laboratory technology.

Key integrations:
- COSMOBOOT unified (primordial knots as dark matter candidates and source of CMB anomalies)
- KNOTBOOT core (eternal anyon braider from ultraclean turbulence, v35)
- BOOTTECH expansion with new designs:
  - Design 10: Quantum Vacuum Torque Engine (harvesting rotational momentum from amplified Casimir vacuum stress, based on Vacuum Torque v2)
  - Design 11: Topological Warp Drive Prototype (fractal shell micro-wormhole thruster using knot-induced negative energy density)

The framework requires no new particles, emerges spacetime and gravity from saturated topological entanglement, and provides falsifiable predictions across cosmology, condensed matter, and quantum vacuum engineering (2026–2040).

All conceptual development, theoretical formulation, design, and writing by Simon Soliman. AI tools used only as assistants – no co-authorship.
